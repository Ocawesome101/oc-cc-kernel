# oc-cc-kernel
*nix-inspired OS for ComputerCraft. Better sandboxing than OC-OS 2.

Requires [OC-EFI](https://github.com/ocawesome101/ocbios/blob/master/uefi.lua) as `startup` in order to boot. Boot files, as well as the kernel image, are found in `/boot/oc-cc-kernel`.

This project is mostly functional. I highly recommend using the installer, which can be found [here.](https://pastebin.com/NVDXKaZF) The installer can be put on a floppy disk and run from it on multiple computers. Alternatively, it can be run directly on a computer with `pastebin run NVDXKaZF`.

I recommend using an advanced computer with CC:Tweaked for best compatibility, though OC-CC-Kernel should work on a standard computer from the original ComputerCraft.
