# oc-cc-kernel
*nix-inspired OS for ComputerCraft. Better sandboxing than OC-OS 2.

Requires [OC-EFI](https://github.com/ocawesome101/ocbios/blob/master/uefi.lua) as `startup` in order to boot. Boot files, as well as the kernel image, are found in `/boot/oc-cc-kernel`.

Is not fully functional yet.
